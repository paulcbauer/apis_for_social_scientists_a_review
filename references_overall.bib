        abstract = {European integration considerably changes public discourses in the member states of the European Union. In this work, I examine the conditions for the Europeanization of public discourse and the nature of Europeanized public discourse. According to a theoretical framework building on postfunctionalist theories of European integration, mainstream opposition and challenger parties with strong positive and negative preferences on European integration have incentives to strategically shape Europeanized public discourse. I test several hypotheses considering three important political issues - economy, security and migration - using a self-compiled data set of about 3 million newspaper articles in 24 different languages from all EU member states retrieved from the Internet Archive between 2016 and 2019. The results indicate that mainstream opposition and challenger parties increase the saliency of Europeanized public discourse. Furthermore, the polarization of Europeanized public discourse builds upon the interaction of challenger parties with strong preferences on European integration and mainstream opposition parties. This work provides a framework and first empirical evidence on the Europeanization of public discourses in all EU member states, using multi-lingual quantitative text analysis on a large data set retrieved from the Internet Archive.},

  abstract = {Social media is increasingly a topic of study across a range of disciplines. Despite this popularity, current practices and open source tools for social media collecting do not adequately support today’s scholars or support building robust collections for future researchers. We are continuing to develop and improve Social Feed Manager (SFM), an open source application assisting scholars collecting data from Twitter’s API for their research. Based on our experience with SFM to date and the viewpoints of archivists and researchers, we are reconsidering assumptions about API-based social media collecting and identifying requirements to guide the application’s further development. We suggest that aligning social media collecting with web archiving practices and tools addresses many of the most pressing needs of current and future scholars conducting quality social media research. In this paper, we consider the basis for these new requirements, describe in depth an alignment between social media collecting and web archiving, outline a technical approach for effecting this alignment, and show how the technical approach has been implemented in SFM.},

There have historically been two answers to the question “what should we archive?” The Internet Archive’s broad entire-web crawls have been supplemented by narrower domain- or topic-specific collections gathered by numerous libraries. We can characterize this as content selection and curation by “gatekeepers”. In contrast, we have witnessed the emergence of another approach driven by “the masses”—we can archive pages that are contained in social media streams such as Twitter. The interesting question, of course, is how these approaches differ. We provide an answer to this question in the context of a case study about the 2015 Canadian federal elections. Based on our analysis, we recommend a hybrid approach that combines an effort driven by social media and more traditional curatorial methods.},

It reviews previous attempts to use web archives to understand national web domains and describes the dataset. Next, it presents an analysis of the .uk domain, including the overall number of links in the archive and changes in the link density of different second-level domains over time. We then explore changes over time within a particular second-level domain, the academic subdomain .ac.uk, and compare linking practices with variables, including institutional affiliation, league table ranking, and geographic location. We do not detect institutional affiliation affecting linking practices and find only partial evidence of league table ranking affecting network centrality, but find a clear inverse relationship between the density of links and the geographical distance between universities. This echoes prior findings regarding offline academic activity, which allows us to argue that real-world factors like geography continue to shape academic relationships even in the Internet age. We conclude with directions for future uses of web archive resources in this emerging area of research.},

  abstract  = {Politics are a fundamental part of human society, and as such, studies have been done to attempt to find ways to predict one's political views, particularly for advertising purposes. In recent years, politicians and political movements have begun to employ the use of popular music or musicians to accompany their causes and advertisements. Studies have been done in the past to determine whether or not a correlation exists between politics and music, yet most have fallen short in data collection or simply did not achieve any results with correlation. This study attempts to go beyond previous studies by using more accurate data reporting with Spotify's API, which allows for data collection from a participant's entire listening history on the platform. All of the programming, survey questions, excel formulas and instructions can be found at https://github.com/ajlacognata/researchspotifyapp if you wish to attempt to replicate this study.},
